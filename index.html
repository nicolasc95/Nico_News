            <p>Wisconsin health officials report more than 1,800 people have tested positive for the coronavirus Sunday. This breaks a five day streak of the state adding more than 2,000 cases a day.</p>
            <p>According to Sunday’s report, 10,815 tests came back and 1,865 were positive, or 17.24%. State officials say Wisconsin is averaging 2,400 cases a day for the past 7 days. A total 132,663 people in Wisconsin have
                 tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 throughout the past 8 months.</p>
            <p>The 7-day average percentage of positive tests, known as the positivity rate, is at 20.23%. That percentage reached 21.71% on Saturday. The 14-day average decreased Sunday to 19.38% after setting a new high 
                Saturday of 19.58%.</p>
            <p>Health officials say the death toll rose by five on Sunday to 1,377. One new death was reported in Dodge, Forest, Shawano, Waukesha and Wood County. </p>
            <p>The death rate for those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 fell to 1.04%, a decrease from Saturday’s report of 1.05%. That percentage has declined since Friday.</p>
            <p>County-by-county case numbers from the Department of Health Services are listed below.</p>
            <p>DHS reports 24,264 currently active cases, meaning 18.3% of all cases over the past 8 months were diagnosed within the last 30 days and haven’t been medically cleared. There are 107,004 people who are considered
                 recovered, which is 80.7% of all cases. For comparison, one month ago 9.5% of all known cases were active and 89% were recovered.</p>
            <p>In the past 24 hours there were 58 more hospitalizations of COVID-19 patients. The 7-day average is up to almost 79 people hospitalized each day. The number of all people diagnosed with the coronavirus requiring 
                hospitalization is up to 7,646. The hospitalization rate is 5.8% of diagnosed cases.</p>

            <p>As of Sunday, the DHS report says the state’s 134 hospitals currently have 714 COVID-19 patients with 194 in intensive care – six fewer in ICU than Saturday. The Wisconsin Hospital Association says 16% of all ICU 
                hospital beds in the state are available.</p>
            <p>The DHS reports Sunday that the 8-county Fox Valley Region had 129 COVID-19 patients, 8 in ICU, with 12% of medical beds available. The Northeast Region has 125 COVID-19 patients in hospitals, 43 in ICU, with 26%
                 of beds available.</p>
            <p>Daily hospitalization numbers take deaths and hospital discharges into account.</p>
            <p>Viewers have asked us how the state compiles its numbers. The state only counts a person once in its summary of positive and negative tests, no matter how many times a person might be tested. 
                The DHS reports deaths attributed to COVID-19 or in which COVID-19 contributed to their death. Most of the people severely affected by the coronavirus have underlying illnesses or conditions, 
                such as diabetes, heart disease or obesity, which sadly affects their chances of dying from COVID-19. The state may revise case and death numbers after further review, such as the victim’s residence, 
                duplicated records, or a correction in lab results. Details can be found on the <a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/index.htm">DHS website</a> and <a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/data-101.htm">Frequently Asked Questions.</a></p>
