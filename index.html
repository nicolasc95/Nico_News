            <p>Wisconsin health officials report more than 1,800 people have tested positive for the coronavirus Sunday. This breaks a five day streak of the state adding more than 2,000 cases a day.</p>
            <p>According to Sunday’s report, 10,815 tests came back and 1,865 were positive, or 17.24%. State officials say Wisconsin is averaging 2,400 cases a day for the past 7 days. A total 132,663 people in Wisconsin have
                 tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 throughout the past 8 months.</p>
            <p>The 7-day average percentage of positive tests, known as the positivity rate, is at 20.23%. That percentage reached 21.71% on Saturday. The 14-day average decreased Sunday to 19.38% after setting a new high 
                Saturday of 19.58%.</p>
            <p>Health officials say the death toll rose by five on Sunday to 1,377. One new death was reported in Dodge, Forest, Shawano, Waukesha and Wood County. </p>
            <p>The death rate for those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 fell to 1.04%, a decrease from Saturday’s report of 1.05%. That percentage has declined since Friday.</p>
            <p>County-by-county case numbers from the Department of Health Services are listed below.</p>
            <p>DHS reports 24,264 currently active cases, meaning 18.3% of all cases over the past 8 months were diagnosed within the last 30 days and haven’t been medically cleared. There are 107,004 people who are considered
                 recovered, which is 80.7% of all cases. For comparison, one month ago 9.5% of all known cases were active and 89% were recovered.</p>
            <p>In the past 24 hours there were 58 more hospitalizations of COVID-19 patients. The 7-day average is up to almost 79 people hospitalized each day. The number of all people diagnosed with the coronavirus requiring 
                hospitalization is up to 7,646. The hospitalization rate is 5.8% of diagnosed cases.</p>

            <p>As of Sunday, the DHS report says the state’s 134 hospitals currently have 714 COVID-19 patients with 194 in intensive care – six fewer in ICU than Saturday. The Wisconsin Hospital Association says 16% of all ICU 
                hospital beds in the state are available.</p>
            <p>The DHS reports Sunday that the 8-county Fox Valley Region had 129 COVID-19 patients, 8 in ICU, with 12% of medical beds available. The Northeast Region has 125 COVID-19 patients in hospitals, 43 in ICU, with 26%
                 of beds available.</p>
            <p>Daily hospitalization numbers take deaths and hospital discharges into account.</p>
            <p>Viewers have asked us how the state compiles its numbers. The state only counts a person once in its summary of positive and negative tests, no matter how many times a person might be tested. 
                The DHS reports deaths attributed to COVID-19 or in which COVID-19 contributed to their death. Most of the people severely affected by the coronavirus have underlying illnesses or conditions, 
                such as diabetes, heart disease or obesity, which sadly affects their chances of dying from COVID-19. The state may revise case and death numbers after further review, such as the victim’s residence, 
                duplicated records, or a correction in lab results. Details can be found on the <a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/index.htm">DHS website</a> and <a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/data-101.htm">Frequently Asked Questions.</a></p>

        <h2>Health Departments overwhelmed</h2>  
            <p>The De Pere and Oneida Nation Health Departments, as well as the Brown County Health and Human Services Department,<a href="https://www.wbay.com/2020/10/03/high-levels-of-covid-19-hospitalizations-deaths-cause-agencies-to-issue-joint-public-health-emergency/">issued a joint Public Health Emergency COVID-19 alert Saturday</a> , citing very high levels of 
                COVID-19 cases resulting in increased COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths.</p>
            <p>This comes after public health departments in the Fox Valley <a href="https://www.wbay.com/2020/10/02/fox-valley-health-departments-issue-covid-19-alert-unable-to-contact-trace/">declared an emergency alert Friday</a> ,
                saying they’re so inundated with new cases they can’t notify people who test positive in a timely manner -- much less their close contacts. Manitowoc and Door county health departments this week announced <a href="https://www.wbay.com/2020/09/29/door-county-public-health-strained-by-growing-coronavirus-cases/">made similar announcements this week</a> .</p>
            <p>State health officials say with local health departments overwhelmed, it’s going to be harder to identify the source of outbreaks. People who test positive are advised to reach out themselves to people who had close contact and ask them to quarantine until the 14th day from their last contact.</p>
        <h2>Guidance for local health departments</h2>
            <p>This week, the DHS released a document local health departments can use for guidance to slow the spread of the virus. <a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/publications/p02789.pdf">You can read the document HERE</a>.</p>
            <p>For counties with Very High case activity -- which is a majority of counties in Northeastern Wisconsin -- the recommendations read very much like the Safer-at-Home order early in the pandemic:</p>
            <!-- list -->
            <ul>
                <li>Consider closing indoor and outdoor bars</li>
                <li>Restaurants should consider only takeout, pickup or delivery</li>
                <li>No indoor gatherings beyond members of the household and limit outdoor gatherings to 10 people or fewer with social distancing and face coverings</li>
                <li>Only essential workers in offices and workplaces with monitoring of symptoms, physical distance and masks</li>
                <li>Limit retail to 5 customers at a time and consider curbside pickup or mail delivery</li>
                <li>Consider not holding outdoor concerts, festivals or sporting events</li>
                <li>Consider not opening gyms or campgrounds except with minimum operations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Health experts say face masks are still the most effective way the general public can slow the spread of the coronavirus, but only if the masks are worn appropriately -- over the nose and chin. County and state 
                health officials are reminding and urging people to stay home when they feel sick, avoid large gatherings, and distance yourself six feet from people who aren’t from your household.</p>
                <p>To help people understand how their decisions affect their own health and others, the Department of Health Services has a decision tool at 
                    <a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/decision.htm">https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/decision.htm</a> . The tool describes how choices matter and offers suggestions to make activities safer.</p>
